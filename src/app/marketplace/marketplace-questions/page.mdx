## Wallet Information

### What kind of wallet do I need to begin?
You can use any EVM compatible wallet. Alchemy provides a nice list of around 60 Ethereum wallet providers at [their dApps directory](https://www.alchemy.com/dapps/list-of/software-wallets-on-ethereum). We have initially developed on MetaMask and Talisman, which offer excellent compatibility with our platform.

### How do I set up a wallet?
Setting up a wallet typically involves these steps:
1. Download a compatible wallet application
2. Create a new wallet and securely save your recovery phrase
3. Add the appropriate blockchain network to your wallet
4. Fund your wallet with the necessary cryptocurrency
5. Connect your wallet to our marketplace

### Can I use multiple wallets?
Yes, you can use different wallets with our platform. However, each wallet address creates a separate identity on the marketplace, so your reputation and transaction history will not transfer between wallets.

## Smart Contracts

### What smart contracts am I signing?
Our marketplace uses six primary smart contracts, though users typically interact with only 3-4 of them:

As a buyer, you would interact with:
- Product listing contract: Obtains overall information about the product and references the seller's wallet address
- Purchase contract factory: Provides your purchase information on-chain (with future ZK encryption for privacy)
- Payment proxy contract: Handles the secure transfer of funds between buyer and seller

As a seller, you would interact with:
- Product creation contract: Determines quantity, types, title, and description of products
- Purchase agreement contract: Created by buyers and accepted by sellers, establishing terms of sale
- Payment proxy contract: Verifies shipping information and manages payment release

### Are the smart contracts audited?
Yes, all smart contracts used in our marketplace undergo rigorous security audits by independent third-party firms. Audit reports are made publicly available, ensuring transparency and security for all users.

## Dispute Management

### What happens if there is a dispute?
We're implementing a comprehensive dispute management system that includes:

- An escrow system that holds payment until delivery is confirmed
- Third-party verification of delivery when requested
- Marketplace authority oversight for dispute resolution
- Optional insurance for lost, stolen, or misdelivered packages

The marketplace authority acts as the final arbiter in case of unresolved disputes, ensuring fair outcomes for all parties.

### How does the insurance model work?
Our insurance model:
- Charges a small optional fee for transaction coverage
- Creates a financial safety net for both buyers and sellers
- Provides compensation for package loss, damage, or delivery issues
- Is managed through smart contracts for transparent operation
- Processes claims based on predefined conditions and verification

## Trust Systems

### How do I know I can trust a seller?
Our platform includes several mechanisms to verify seller trustworthiness:

1. Direct verification from marketplace authorities
2. Comprehensive profile information
3. Transaction history and marketplace reputation
4. Overall blockchain activity analysis
5. Account age measurement from initial transaction
6. Token holdings as stake in the ecosystem

### How do I know I can trust a buyer?
We provide similar trust metrics for buyers:

1. Previous purchase and sales history
2. Profile completeness and verification level
3. Optional manual verification for a small fee
4. Direct messaging for pre-transaction communication
5. Reputation scoring based on transaction behavior

### What can I buy and sell?
You can purchase and sell products that comply with:
- Your country's and state's regulations
- Marketplace terms of service
- Community standards

The marketplace reserves the right to report suspicious activity and prohibit transactions of illegal or prohibited items.
