## Organizational Structure

Arthur Labs marketplaces operate under a multi-tiered structure designed to support decentralized commerce while maintaining necessary oversight:

1. **Arthur Labs** hosts the marketplace facilitation and development process of each Web3 Marketplace.

2. **Partners** moderate and run marketing efforts on behalf of the marketplace, handling announcements, procedures, operational control, recommendations for changes, and various other resources, collaborations, and efforts.

3. **Clients** act as sellers and purchasers, or small businesses and their customers. Small businesses operate in their own interest and use the platform to access a new range of clients.

4. Each marketplace runs on a dedicated blockchain using a dedicated cryptocurrency, with specifications tailored to specific needs.

3. **Distribution Structure**:
   - A portion of revenue supports ongoing platform development
