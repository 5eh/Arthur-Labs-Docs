## Blockchain Technology

### What are blockchains?

Blockchains are distributed digital ledgers that record transactions across many computers simultaneously in a way that prevents records from being altered retroactively. Each "block" contains a timestamp and transaction data, linked together in a "chain" using cryptography. This creates a permanent, transparent, and tamper-resistant record of all transactions.

### Why does this marketplace use blockchains?

Our marketplace utilizes blockchain technology for several compelling reasons:

1. **Immutable Transaction Records**: Blockchains provide permanent proof that transactions occurred
2. **Smart Contract Automation**: [Smart contracts](/marketplace/smart-contracts) enable secure, automated transaction processes
3. **Business Authenticity**: Small businesses can build verifiable sales history for potential investors
4. **Immediate Settlement**: Businesses receive payment for their sales without traditional delays
5. **Crypto Adoption**: Both businesses and clients can utilize cryptocurrencies as viable proof of transactions
6. **Practical Utility**: People can benefit from blockchain infrastructure beyond speculative assets like meme coins or NFTs

## Decentralization

### How is this application "decentralized"?

Our marketplace implements progressive decentralization, meaning we gradually transition from centralized to decentralized systems as we develop and grow:

1. **Distributed Listings**: Moving away from centralized listing databases
2. **DAO Governance**: Converting to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization to govern marketplace rules
3. **IPFS Integration**: Connecting to the InterPlanetary File System to store transactions and fulfillment proofs
4. **Access Expansion**: Making the platform more accessible for small businesses to sell safely
5. **Trust Systems**: Adding blockchain-based insurance models to ensure safe transactions

This approach allows us to balance user experience with the benefits of decentralization, creating a path toward greater autonomy while maintaining security and usability.

## Practical Usage

### What crypto wallet should I use?

While you can use any compatible wallet, we understand that wallet management can be challenging for newcomers. That's why we're building account abstraction tools that simplify the experience:

- **Guest Accounts**: Allowing new users to start without traditional wallet setup
- **Streamlined Checkout**: Simplifying the transaction process
- **KYC + 2FA Authentication**: Providing alternative security methods
- **Reduced Onboarding Friction**: Eliminating complicated steps in the Web3 experience

Our goal is to remove these barriers without compromising the benefits of blockchain technology.

### Why should I care about this technology?

The truth is, you shouldn't have to care about the underlying technology! We've built our marketplace using secure, public, and reputable blockchain infrastructure so that you can focus on what matters: buying and selling safely.

Our approach is to make the technology robust and invisible, allowing you to benefit from its advantages (security, transparency, efficiency) without needing to understand the technical details. We've done the complex work so you can simply enjoy a better marketplace experience.
