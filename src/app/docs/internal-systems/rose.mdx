# ROSE - Web3 Integration System

ROSE enables seamless Web3 functionality through smart contracts and blockchain integration, making it easy to transition marketplaces from Web2 to Web3. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Overview {{ anchor: 'overview' }}

ROSE (Web3 Integration System) is Arthur Labs' solution for enabling blockchain functionality in digital marketplaces. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and infrastructure that allow entrepreneurs to leverage the benefits of Web3 without requiring extensive blockchain knowledge.

ROSE helps accelerate real-world trade and exchange into Web3 and provides excellent opportunities to build immutable portfolios without participants needing to understand the infrastructure, allowing them to reap the benefits of blockchain technology without technical barriers.

The primary goals of ROSE include:

1. Enabling privacy and authenticity for physical deliverable commerce
2. Providing transparent and immutable transaction records
3. Creating standards for decentralized commerce across multiple blockchains
4. Simplifying the onboarding process for Web2 users into Web3
5. Building trust through verification and validation mechanisms

## Smart Contracts {{ anchor: 'smart-contracts' }}

ROSE implements several specialized smart contract types to enable Web3 functionality in marketplaces:

### Commerce Contracts

Commerce contracts handle the sale and purchase of physical goods, providing:

- Product information storage and verification
- Secure payment processing
- Delivery tracking and confirmation
- Product authenticity verification
- Buyer protection mechanisms

These contracts include features like:
- Product title, description, and imagery storage
- Origin location and shipping information
- Seller identity verification
- Quantity and time validity parameters

### Service Contracts

Service contracts facilitate the provision of services through blockchain, including:

- Service description and provider information
- Booking and scheduling functionality
- Verification of service completion
- Reputation and review systems
- Payment release mechanisms

### Delivery Contracts

Specialized contracts for tracking and verifying the delivery of physical goods:

- Real-time location tracking (via XYO integration)
- Delivery confirmation and proof
- Dispute resolution mechanisms
- Multi-party verification options

## Blockchain Integration {{ anchor: 'blockchain-integration' }}

ROSE is designed to be blockchain-agnostic, supporting multiple chains and protocols:

### Supported Blockchains

- **Ethereum**: Primary deployment for commerce contracts
- **Quai**: Alternative for lower-cost transactions
- **Tezos**: Support for smart contracts using camelLIGO and SmartPy
- **Polkadot**: Cross-chain interoperability via Moonbeam

### Protocol Integrations

ROSE integrates with specialized Web3 protocols to enhance functionality:

- **XYO**: On-chain GPS tracking for delivery verification
- **Waku**: On-chain messaging for secure communications
- **Moonbeam**: Blockchain bridging between Layer 0 networks
- **Kleros**: On-chain dispute resolution for transaction conflicts
- **Watr**: On-chain commodity value tracking/creation (Polkadot ecosystem)
- **Kasuma**: Reduced cost of on-chain deployment (Polkadot ecosystem)

## Privacy & Security {{ anchor: 'privacy-security' }}

ROSE implements several privacy and security mechanisms:

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

- Buyer information is encrypted in delivery contracts using ZK-proofs
- Personal data remains private while enabling transaction verification
- Optional identity verification without exposing personal details

### Authenticity Verification

- Optional product authenticity verification through Chainlink oracles
- Third-party verification mechanisms for product legitimacy
- Immutable proof of authenticity stored on-chain

### Legal Compliance

- Smart contracts designed for legal compliance in US, UK, and EU
- Compliant transaction and dispute resolution processes
- GDPR-compatible data handling practices

## Tech Stack {{ anchor: 'tech-stack' }}

ROSE leverages multiple technologies across its stack:

### Smart Contract Development
- Solidity (Ethereum)
- camelLIGO and SmartPy (Tezos)
- Substrate development framework (Polkadot)

### Infrastructure
- IPFS for decentralized storage of product imagery and details
- Chainlink for oracle services and external data
- ZK-proof implementations for privacy

### Integration
- Web3.js and Ethers.js for Ethereum interactions
- Custom APIs for blockchain communication
- Cross-chain bridges for multi-chain support

ROSE is continually evolving to incorporate new blockchain technologies and improve the Web3 experience for marketplace users.
