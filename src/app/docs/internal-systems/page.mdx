# Internal Systems

Arthur Labs is developing a suite of powerful systems that work together to revolutionize entrepreneurship in the Web3 space. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## DEAN - Digital Bazaar Factory {{ anchor: 'dean' }}

DEAN is Arthur Labs' Digital Bazaar Factory, a groundbreaking system designed to revolutionize how entrepreneurs build and launch Web3-enabled marketplaces. By identifying and standardizing approximately 25+ essential components common to all marketplaces — from explore sections and checkout processes to messaging features and user profiles — DEAN dramatically reduces the development timeline from 6–12 months to less than a week, enabling rapid market testing and iteration.

What sets DEAN apart is its seamless integration of Web3 functionality. The system incorporates smart contract standards for commerce, services, and deliveries, allowing entrepreneurs to deploy their marketplaces with built-in blockchain capabilities. Through DEAN, marketplace owners can offer their users transparent transaction histories, immutable product authenticity verification, and secure escrow services powered by smart contracts. The system handles complex blockchain interactions behind the scenes, making Web3 features accessible even to users unfamiliar with cryptocurrency.

Most importantly, DEAN is designed with flexibility in mind. Its blockchain-agnostic configuration system allows marketplace owners to specify their preferred chain and native currency, while its factory contract architecture enables rapid deployment of customized smart contracts for each listing. This means entrepreneurs can focus on their unique value proposition and market fit, while DEAN handles the technical complexities of both traditional marketplace functionality and Web3 integration.
