# DeFi Lending Tax Guide: Wyoming, Fundora, and Stablecoin Yields

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending has transformed how people earn yield on crypto. Platforms like Fundora, Aave, and Compound let anyone become a lender — earning interest directly from borrowers without intermediaries.

But with yield comes taxes. Here's everything you need to know about reporting DeFi lending income in 2026.

## How DeFi Lending Works

DeFi lending works differently than traditional banking:

### Traditional Lending
```
You → Bank → Borrower
Bank takes a cut, gives you interest
```

### DeFi Lending
```
You → Smart Contract → Borrower
No bank, you get full yield minus small protocol fee
```

### Key Platforms

| Platform | Asset Types | Chain | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|-------|
| **Fundora** | Stablecoins | Solana | WYST pilot participant |
| **Aave** | ETH, Stablecoins | Multi-chain | Market leading |
| **Compound** | ETH, Tokens | Ethereum | Institutional grade |
| **Lido** | stETH | Ethereum | Liquid staking |

### How You Earn

1. **Deposit collateral** — Supply crypto to lending pool
2. **Earn interest** — Paid in protocol token or same asset
3. **Withdraw** — Get principal + accrued interest

## Tax Treatment Overview

The IRS treats DeFi lending income as **ordinary income**, not capital gains.

### The Basic Rule

> Every time you receive tokens from a DeFi protocol — whether interest, rewards, or yield — it's taxable income at fair market value.

### Income vs Capital Gains

| Event | Tax Type |
|-------|----------|
| **Interest earned** | Ordinary income |
| **Yield rewards** | Ordinary income |
| **LP token appreciation** | Capital gains |
| **Staking rewards** | Ordinary income |

### Example

You supply 1,000 USDC to Fundora for one year:

- **Interest received:** $50 USDC
- **Tax:** $50 × your income tax rate

If you later sell the 1,000 USDC for $1,050 (original + interest):

- **Cost basis:** $1,000
- **Sale price:** $1,050
- **Gain:** $50 — Capital gains

You pay tax twice: income tax on the $50 interest, capital gains on the $50 appreciation.

## Income Reporting

### Form 1099

| Platform Type | Issues 1099? |
|---------------|---------------|
| Centralized (Fundora) | Possibly* |
| Decentralized (Aave) | No |
| Hybrid | Varies |

*Fundora may issue 1099-INT if interest exceeds $600

### Self-Reporting

Even without a 1099, you're required to report all DeFi income:

**Schedule 1 (Form 1040)**
- Line 2: Taxable interest
- Line 8: Other income — includes crypto interest

**Schedule D (Form 1040)**
- Capital gains from selling DeFi positions

### Tracking Requirements

You need to track:

| Data Point | Why It Matters |
|------------|---------------|
| **Cost basis** | Determines capital gains |
| **Fair market value at receipt** | Calculates income amount |
| **Date received** | Determines holding period |
| **Protocol name** | For audit documentation |

## Fundora Specifics

Fundora is a Wyoming-based P2P lending platform with unique characteristics:

### Features

- **P2P Model** — Direct lending, not pooled
- **WYST Integration** — Accepts Wyoming stablecoin
- **No Traditional Banking** — Fully decentralized
- **Bulla Network Powered** — Blockchain-based accounting

### Tax Considerations for Fundora

1. **Interest Income** — Taxed as ordinary income
2. **Multiple Lenders** — Each interest payment is separate event
3. **Stablecoin Focus** — Most lending in USDC, USDT, FRNT
4. **Wyoming Jurisdiction** — State law may affect treatment

### Reporting Fundora Income

```
Interest Received (USDC) × Fair Market Value (USD) = Taxable Income
Example: 50 USDC × $1.00 = $50 income
```

### Record Keeping

For Fundora (and all DeFi):

- [ ] Transaction hashes for each lending/deposit
- [ ] Screenshots of interest accrual
- [ ] Token price at time of each reward
- [ ] Total interest earned per tax year

## Wyoming Advantages

If you're using Wyoming-based platforms, you get specific benefits:

### No State Income Tax

Wyoming doesn't have a state income tax. This means:

| State | DeFi Income Tax |
|-------|-----------------|
| California | Up to 13.3% |
| New York | Up to 10.9% |
| **Wyoming** | **0%** |

### Business-Friendly Regulation

Wyoming's approach to DeFi:

- Clear DAO legal framework
- Stablecoin integration (FRNT)
- Progressive crypto legislation
- No aggressive enforcement

### Fundora Connection

Fundora participates in Wyoming's stablecoin pilot:

- Accepts WYST (Wyoming Stable Token)
- Subject to Wyoming law
- First-mover advantage in compliant DeFi

## Best Practices

### 1. Track Everything In Real-Time

Don't wait until tax season. Record each:

- Deposit transaction
- Interest payment (often automated)
- Withdrawal
- Token swap

### 2. Use Proper Cost Basis

- FIFO (First In, First Out) is safest
- Specific identification for large positions
- Keep records of each lot

### 3. Convert Income to USD Promptly

If you receive interest in crypto, value it in USD immediately. This becomes your income basis.

### 4. Consider Tax-Loss Harvesting

DeFi volatility creates opportunities:

- Sell losing positions
- Offset gains with losses
- Reinvest after 30 days (wash sale rules apply)

### 5. Consult a Specialist

DeFi tax is complex. A crypto tax professional can:

- Identify all taxable events
- Maximize deductions
- Ensure compliance

## Summary

DeFi lending offers incredible yield opportunities, but comes with tax obligations:

- **Interest = Ordinary Income** — Report on Schedule 1
- **Capital Gains** — When you sell appreciated positions
- **Wyoming Advantage** — No state income tax
- **Documentation** — Track every transaction in real-time
- **Platform Matters** — Fundora and compliant DeFi = easier reporting

The future of finance is here. Make sure you're prepared for tax day.
