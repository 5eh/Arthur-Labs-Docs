# DEAN Quickstart Guide

Get started with DEAN, Arthur Labs' Digital Bazaar Factory, in under 30 minutes. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and creating your first marketplace. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Prerequisites {{ anchor: 'prerequisites' }}

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** (v7 or higher) or **yarn** (v1.22 or higher)
- **Git**
- **MongoDB** (local or cloud instance)

Additionally, basic knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript and React will be helpful, though not strictly necessary for getting started.

## Installation {{ anchor: 'installation' }}

### 1. Clone the DEAN Repository

Start by cloning the DEAN repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/5eh/Arthur-Labs.git
cd Arthur-Labs
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/dean
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=3000
```

Replace `mongodb://localhost:27017/dean` with your MongoDB connection string if you're using a cloud instance.

## Configuration {{ anchor: 'configuration' }}

DEAN uses a configuration-based approach to customize marketplaces. The main configuration file is located at `src/config/marketplace.config.js`.

### Basic Configuration

Open the configuration file and update the basic settings:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  marketplaceName: 'My Marketplace',
  marketplaceDescription: 'A description of my marketplace',
  marketplaceType: 'commerce', // Options: 'commerce', 'service', 'delivery'
  theme: {
    primaryColor: '#3498db',
    secondaryColor: '#2ecc71',
    fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif',
  },
  features: {
    userAuth: true,
    messaging: true,
    reviews: true,
    search: true,
    categories: true,
    payments: true,
    notifications: true,
  },
};
```

### Component Selection

DEAN provides 25+ pre-built components. Enable or disable them based on your marketplace needs:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ... previous configuration
  components: {
    userProfile: {
      enabled: true,
      verificationRequired: false,
    },
    listings: {
      enabled: true,
      moderationRequired: false,
      categoriesEnabled: true,
      tagsEnabled: true,
    },
    checkout: {
      enabled: true,
      paymentMethods: ['credit-card', 'paypal'],
    },
    messaging: {
      enabled: true,
      realTimeEnabled: true,
    },
    reviews: {
      enabled: true,
      moderationRequired: false,
    },
    search: {
      enabled: true,
      advancedFilters: true,
    },
  },
};
```

## Creating Your First Marketplace {{ anchor: 'first-marketplace' }}

Now that you've configured DEAN, let's create your first marketplace.

### 1. Initialize the Database

Run the database initialization script:

```bash
npm run db:init
# or
yarn db:init
```

This will set up the initial database structure based on your configuration.

### 2. Start the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The server will start at http://localhost:3000.

### 3. Access the Admin Dashboard

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/admin in your browser and log in with the default credentials:

- **Email**: admin@example.com
- **Password**: password123

You should change these credentials immediately after your first login.

### 4. Configure Your Marketplace

Use the admin dashboard to further configure your marketplace:

1. **General Settings**: Set the marketplace name, description, and logo
2. **Categories**: Add marketplace categories and subcategories
3. **User Roles**: Configure user permission roles
4. **Payment Settings**: Set up payment gateways
5. **Email Templates**: Customize notification emails

### 5. Create Sample Listings

To test your marketplace, create some sample listings:

1. Navigate to "Listings" in the admin dashboard
2. Click "Add New Listing"
3. Fill in the sample listing details
4. Publish the listing

You can also create test user accounts to experience the marketplace from a user's perspective.
